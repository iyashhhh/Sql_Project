Problem Statement:
G Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV). In the
last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid vehicles segment in
North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their
bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. Rahul Tendulkar,
the chief of G Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study of existing EV/Hybrid
market in India before proceeding further. Rahul gave this task to the data analytics
team of G motors and I am the data analyst working in this team.
